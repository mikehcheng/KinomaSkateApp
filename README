SkateBud, a personal skateboarding assistant, built with Kinoma JS.

Skatebud allows users to compete in games with skaters of their same skill level, 
locate and check-in at local skate parts and learn new tricks through our trick manual 
and light up sensors.  Skatebudâ€™s sensors help skaters learn while also tracking their 
tricks in order to award them points in their games against other skaters.  

Skatebud allows skaters the opportunity to outreach to nearby and far away skaters of all 
levels!
