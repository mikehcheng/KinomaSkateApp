SkateBud, a personal skateboarding assistant, built with Kinoma JS.

Our app allows users to compete in games with skaters of their same skill level, locate and check-in at local skate parts and learn new tricks through our trick manual and light up sensors. Sensors on the board interface with SkateBud to help skaters learn, while also tracking their tricks in order to award them points in their games against other skaters.

With Skatebud, skaters have the opportunity to engage with skaters far and wide, of all skill levels!

Running SkateBud:

After the repository has been pulled, there will be two folders, SkateDevice and SkatePhone. These should be imported as separate projects in the Kinoma project explorer. Run the device first and then the phone. The phone should output to the console "Found the device" once it has connected. Once attached, the app should function as expected.
